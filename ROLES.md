# MOSN Community Roles

This document describes the set of roles individuals may have within the MOSN community.

## User

A ***user*** is someone that uses MOSN. They contribute to MOSN projects by providing feedback to developers in the form of bug reports and feature suggestions. Users participate in the MOSN community by helping other users.

## Contributor

A ***contributor*** is a user who contributes to the project in the form of code or documentation. They take extra steps to participate in a project, are active on the community, participate in discussions, provide patches, documentation, suggestions, and criticism. 

## Committer

A ***committer*** is a developer that was given **write access** to the code repository. Not needing to depend on other people for the patches, they are actually making short-term decisions for the project. The PMC can (even tacitly) agree and approve it into permanency, or they can reject it. Remember that the PMC makes the decisions, not the individual committers.

## PMC

A ***PMC member*** is a developer or a committer that was elected due to merit for the evolution of the project and demonstration of commitment. They have write access to the code repository, the right to vote for the community-related decisions and the right to propose an active user for committership. The PMC as a whole is the entity that controls the project, nobody else.
